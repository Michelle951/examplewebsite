I’m a technical documentation engineer and experienced Chinese–English translator. I write technical documentation for various products, including but not limited to cloud-native PaaS platforms and office software.

Although my academic background is in the humanities, I discovered a passion for computing when I started typing codes in the terminal and watching it render into familiar website styles and behaviors—an addictive process that sparked my curiosity and drove me to learn more.

I’m currently studying front-end technologies and cloud-native fundamentals, and I also use AI tools to help write codes and polish documentation. I enjoy turning complex systems into clear, practical guides that help teams and users get things done.
